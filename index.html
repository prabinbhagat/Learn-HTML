<!--Brief summary
HTML IS the languae in which most websites are written.
HTML is used to create webpages and make then functional.
The code used to make then visually appealing is known as CSS.

HTML was created by Sir Tim Bernes Lee in the year 1989.
HT-HyperText-Meaning it contains links to other places in the document or to a new document altogether.
ML-MarkupLanguage is the language computer used to communicate and process and present text. Now to do this it uses

Tags & Attributes they are the basis of HTML they work together but perform different functions.

TAGS are used to markup the start of the HTML element and they are usually enclosed in the angel brackets. eg  <h1>
Most tags must be opened <h1> and closed </h1> to make them functional.

ATTRIBUTES contains additional pieces of information. It takes the form of opening tag and additional information is placed inside
eg. <img src = "ram.jpg" alt = "This is a picture of ram"> 
in the above case image source (src) and alternate text (alt) are attribute of img tag.

Now lets see the basic construction of a HTML page
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>     <!--This tag specifies the language we will write in the page in our case it is HTML5-->>
<html lang="en">    <!--This tag signals from here we will write HTML code-->
<head>              <!--This tag contains all the METADATA FOR THE PAGE stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer program-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>              <!--This body tag is where all the DCONTENT OF THE PAGES goes-->
    
</body>
</html>

<!-------------------So as shown above all the average HTML page is structured visually-------------------->

<!--Lets See some more Tags-
    Inside the <head> tag there is one tag which is always included which is <title> tag
        <title> this is where we will inculde the page name that is displayed on top of browser or tab </title>
        <meta> this is where all the information about the document is stored: like character encoding,name(page content),description

        Basic <head> section
        <head>
            <title> my first webpage </title>
            <meta charset = "utf-8">
            <meta name = "description" content = "this field include description about your page. it is usually two sentence lomg.">
            <meta name = "author Prabiin"  content = "Conor Sheilaji">
        </head>
