<!--Brief summary
HTML IS the languae in which most websites are written.
HTML is used to create webpages and make then functional.
The code used to make then visually appealing is known as CSS.

HTML was created by Sir Tim Bernes Lee in the year 1989.
HT-HyperText-Meaning it contains links to other places in the document or to a new document altogether.
ML-MarkupLanguage is the language computer used to communicate and process and present text. Now to do this it uses

Tags & Attributes they are the basis of HTML they work together but perform different functions.

TAGS are used to markup the start of the HTML element and they are usually enclosed in the angel brackets. eg  <h1>
Most tags must be opened <h1> and closed </h1> to make them functional.

ATTRIBUTES contains additional pieces of information. It takes the form of opening tag and additional information is placed inside
eg. <img src = "ram.jpg" alt = "This is a picture of ram"> 
in the above case image source (src) and alternate text (alt) are attribute of img tag.

Now lets see the basic construction of a HTML page
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>     <!--This tag specifies the language we will write in the page in our case it is HTML5-->>
<html lang="en">    <!--This tag signals from here we will write HTML code-->
<head>              <!--This tag contains all the METADATA FOR THE PAGE stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer program-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>              <!--This body tag is where all the DCONTENT OF THE PAGES goes-->
    
</body>
</html>

<!-------------------So as shown above all the average HTML page is structured visually-------------------->

<!--Lets See some more Tags-
    Inside the <head> tag there is one tag which is always included which is <title> tag
        <title> this is where we will inculde the page name that is displayed on top of browser or tab </title>
        <meta> this is where all the information about the document is stored: like character encoding,name(page content),description

        Basic <head> section
        <head>
            <title> my first webpage </title>
            <meta charset = "utf-8">
            <meta name = "description" content = "this field include description about your page. it is usually two sentence lomg.">
            <meta name = "author Prabiin"  content = "Conor Sheilaji">
        </head>
        
    Next tag is <body> tag
        The HTML <body> is where we add all the content which is designed to view by human eyes.
        this includes text,images,tables, forms and everyting ele that we see on the internet each day.

        In HTML headings are written in following elements
        <h1>
            <h2>
                <h3>
                    <h4>
                        <h5>
                            <h6>
        
        <h1> and <h2> should be used for most important titles , while the remainings tags should be used for sub headings
        
        search engine bots uses this order for deciphering which infromation is most important on a page.

        In HTML text can be added using <p> paragraph tags
        <p> tag creates a NEW PARAGRAPH we place all of our regular text inside the element</p>

        For writng Text in HTML, we also have a number of other elements we can use to CONTROL THE TEXT OR MAKE IT APPEAR IN A CERTAIN WAY
        
        OTHER KEY ELEMENTS ARE

        Element	    Meaning	             Purpose
        <b>	        Bold	             Highlight important information
        <strong>	Strong	             Similarly to bold, to highlight key text
        <i>	        Italic	             To denote text
        <em>    	Emphasised Text      Usually used as image captions
        <mark>  	Marked Text	         Highlight the background of the text
        <small> 	Small Text	         To shrink the text
        <strike>	Striked Out Text     To place a horizontal line across the text
        <u>	        Underlined Text	     Used for links or text highlights
        <ins>	    Inserted Text	     Displayed with an underline to show an inserted text
        <sub>   	Subscript Text  	 Typographical stylistic choice
        <sup>   	Superscript Text	 Another typographical presentation style

        These tags must be opened and closed around the text in question.

        HOW TO ADD LINK IN MY HTML--<a> tag to rescue
        Links are included in an attribute opened by <a> tag.

            The ANCHOR Tag <a> is writtet in the format
            <a href = "www.google.com">Google Website</a>
            here the first part is the link that gets open when user clicks and the second part is the text that will get displayed.

            If you are building a website of you own then the internal links on your website will be :
            <a href = "mylinkedpage.html">linktitle</a>

        HOW TO ADD IMAGES TO MY HTML PAGE
        The IMAGE <img> tag has everthing to display images on a website.   
        Like anchor tag image tag also has attribute .
        The ATTRIBUTE FEATURES information for your computer regarding the SOURCE,HEIGHT,WIDTH and ALT TEXT of the image.

        We can also define the borders and other styles around image using the CLASS attribute.
        The file types generally used for image files online are: .jpg, .png, and (less and less) .gif.

       HOW TO MAKE AN HTML LIST
       IN web design there are three types of list
       1. Unorderd List       <ul>
       2. Orderd List         <ol>
       3. Defination List     <dl>

       1. Unordered List: Basically Contains Bullet Points, it is used when order of element in list is not important
            Basic Lists
            Common Web Browser
            *Edge
            *Chrome
            *Firefox
            *Safari
            *Opera
       
       2. Ordered List: Bascially Contains some kind of numeric counter preceding the element
            Basic Ordered list
            Top five dog name in USA
            1.Max
            2.Jake
            3.Buddy
            4.Maggie
            5.Bear

        #. Making Nested List: Sometimes we want to create outline for other kinds of complex data in our page.We can easily nest list
            Nested Lists
            Popular Cat Names
            *USA
                1.Tigger
                2.Tiger

                3.Tiger
                4.Sam
                5.Misty

       3. Defination List: Basically it Contains Terms and its Defination.It was designed to perform dictionary style defination.
            This list dosent use bullet or numbers instead it has two elements <dt> and <dd>
                Defination Term        <dt> : This are Bascially word or short Pharase
                Defination Description <dd> : This are extened text block containing actual defination.
            
            Basic Defination list

            IE
                    Microsofts entry into the browser market, and a dominant player.
            Firefox
                    An open-source browser that has shaken up the world.

        EXTRAS--------------------------------

        SUPPOSE I WANT TO INSERT 10 RANDOM WORDS THEN USING EMMET WE CAN DO SO
            lorem10 then press enter
        SUPPOSE I WAN TO CREATE 4 <P> PARAGRAPH TAG THEN
            P*4 THEN PRESS ENTER
        IF YOU WANT TO USE BOLD FOR PARTICUALR TEXT THEN INSTEAD OF USEING <b> BOLD TAG USE <strong> tag.
        IF YOU WANT TO USE ITALIC FOR A PARTICUAL TEXT THEN INSTEAD OF USING <i> italic tag use <em> EMPHASIS TAG
        
        TO insert a line break use <br> tag it is a self closing tag we donot need to close this tag manually. It is not a good practice to use <br> for line break.
        TO insert a Horizontal line use <hr> Horizontal Rule tag. it is also a self closing tag.

        How TO ADD TABLE <table> IN HTML
        wONDER WHAT DOES A TABLE CONSIST OF:
        1.Table Row         <tr>
            each table row can consist of a number of table datat<dt> or table header <th>
        2.Table Columns
        3.Data inside Row <td>

        Here are the tables tags presented in a table â€“ pun totally intended.

        Table Tag   	Meaning	         Location
        <thead> 	    Table Head  	Top of the table
        <tbody>	        Table Body  	Content of the table
        <tfoot>     	Table Foot	    Bottom of the table
        <colgroup>  	Column Group	Within the table
        <th>	        Table Header	Data cell for the table header

        Tables, borders, spacing are usually styled using

        What if in the same table an item takes more than one row or one column.
        For this <colspan> and <rowspan> comes to rescue when we have same item reflicing for more than one row or column.
        
        BLOCK-LEVEL and IN-LINE ELEMENTS.
        All the tags so far we have seen are block elements i.e., this elements begins and end with Carriage Returns.
        eg. <h1> tag occupy line above and below. each <p> set has implied space above and below it. Most of the
        HTML tag are block-level.

        While some tags are meant to be embedded inside block-level tags and don't interrupt the flow of the text. The anchor
        tag never stand on their own in HTML body.

        MAKING A LIST OF ANCHOR TAG / ABSOLUTE REFERENCE.

        Some nice programming books.
        * Html
        * Javascript
        * online programmings
        * html4

        WORKING WITH Absolute and Relative refrences
        ABSOLUTE REFERENCE: So far, we have seen only absolute reference absolute reference is complete web address which begins 
                            wiht http:// it is used to refer site somewhere else on internet.
        
        RELATIVE REFERENCE: This is used when the webpage you are building includes more than one page. we might choose to have
                            several pages and a link mechanism for moving among them.
