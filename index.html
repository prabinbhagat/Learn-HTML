<!--Brief summary
HTML IS the languae in which most websites are written.
HTML is used to create webpages and make then functional.
The code used to make then visually appealing is known as CSS.

HTML was created by Sir Tim Bernes Lee in the year 1989.
HT-HyperText-Meaning it contains links to other places in the document or to a new document altogether.
ML-MarkupLanguage is the language computer used to communicate and process and present text. Now to do this it uses

Tags & Attributes they are the basis of HTML they work together but perform different functions.

TAGS are used to markup the start of the HTML element and they are usually enclosed in the angel brackets. eg  <h1>
Most tags must be opened <h1> and closed </h1> to make them functional.

ATTRIBUTES contains additional pieces of information. It takes the form of opening tag and additional information is placed inside
eg. <img src = "ram.jpg" alt = "This is a picture of ram"> 
in the above case image source (src) and alternate text (alt) are attribute of img tag.

Now lets see the basic construction of a HTML page
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>     <!--This tag specifies the language we will write in the page in our case it is HTML5-->>
<html lang="en">    <!--This tag signals from here we will write HTML code-->
<head>              <!--This tag contains all the METADATA FOR THE PAGE stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer program-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>              <!--This body tag is where all the DCONTENT OF THE PAGES goes-->
    
</body>
</html>

<!-------------------So as shown above all the average HTML page is structured visually-------------------->

<!--Lets See some more Tags-
    Inside the <head> tag there is one tag which is always included which is <title> tag
        <title> this is where we will inculde the page name that is displayed on top of browser or tab </title>
        <meta> this is where all the information about the document is stored: like character encoding,name(page content),description

        Basic <head> section
        <head>
            <title> my first webpage </title>
            <meta charset = "utf-8">
            <meta name = "description" content = "this field include description about your page. it is usually two sentence lomg.">
            <meta name = "author Prabiin"  content = "Conor Sheilaji">
        </head>
        
    Next tag is <body> tag
        The HTML <body> is where we add all the content which is designed to view by human eyes.
        this includes text,images,tables, forms and everyting ele that we see on the internet each day.

        In HTML headings are written in following elements
        <h1>
            <h2>
                <h3>
                    <h4>
                        <h5>
                            <h6>
        
        <h1> and <h2> should be used for most important titles , while the remainings tags should be used for sub headings
        
        search engine bots uses this order for deciphering which infromation is most important on a page.

        In HTML text can be added using <p> paragraph tags
        <p> tag creates a NEW PARAGRAPH we place all of our regular text inside the element</p>

        For writng Text in HTML, we also have a number of other elements we can use to CONTROL THE TEXT OR MAKE IT APPEAR IN A CERTAIN WAY
        
        OTHER KEY ELEMENTS ARE

        Element	    Meaning	             Purpose
        <b>	        Bold	             Highlight important information
        <strong>	Strong	             Similarly to bold, to highlight key text
        <i>	        Italic	             To denote text
        <em>    	Emphasised Text      Usually used as image captions
        <mark>  	Marked Text	         Highlight the background of the text
        <small> 	Small Text	         To shrink the text
        <strike>	Striked Out Text     To place a horizontal line across the text
        <u>	        Underlined Text	     Used for links or text highlights
        <ins>	    Inserted Text	     Displayed with an underline to show an inserted text
        <sub>   	Subscript Text  	 Typographical stylistic choice
        <sup>   	Superscript Text	 Another typographical presentation style

        These tags must be opened and closed around the text in question.

        HOW TO ADD LINK IN MY HTML--<a> tag to rescue
        Links are included in an attribute opened by <a> tag.

            The ANCHOR Tag <a> is writtet in the format
            <a href = "www.google.com">Google Website</a>
            here the first part is the link that gets open when user clicks and the second part is the text that will get displayed.

            If you are building a website of you own then the internal links on your website will be :
            <a href = "mylinkedpage.html">linktitle</a>

        HOW TO ADD IMAGES TO MY HTML PAGE
        The IMAGE <img> tag has everthing to display images on a website.   
        Like anchor tag image tag also has attribute .
        The ATTRIBUTE FEATURES information for your computer regarding the SOURCE,HEIGHT,WIDTH and ALT TEXT of the image.

        We can also define the borders and other styles around image using the CLASS attribute.
        The file types generally used for image files online are: .jpg, .png, and (less and less) .gif.

       HOW TO MAKE AN HTML LIST
       IN web design there are three types of list
       1. Unorderd List       <ul>
       2. Orderd List         <ol>
       3. Defination List     <dl>

       1. Unordered List: Basically Contains Bullet Points, it is used when order of element in list is not important
            Basic Lists
            Common Web Browser
            *Edge
            *Chrome
            *Firefox
            *Safari
            *Opera
       
       2. Ordered List: Bascially Contains some kind of numeric counter preceding the element
            Basic Ordered list
            Top five dog name in USA
            1.Max
            2.Jake
            3.Buddy
            4.Maggie
            5.Bear

        #. Making Nested List: Sometimes we want to create outline for other kinds of complex data in our page.We can easily nest list

                4.Sam
                5.Misty

       3. Defination List: Basically it Contains Terms and its Defination.It was designed to perform dictionary style defination.
            This list dosent use bullet or numbers instead it has two elements <dt> and <dd>
                Defination Term        <dt> : This are Bascially word or short Pharase
                Defination Description <dd> : This are extened text block containing actual defination.

        IF YOU WANT TO USE ITALIC FOR A PARTICUAL TEXT THEN INSTEAD OF USING <i> italic tag use <em> EMPHASIS TAG
        
        TO insert a line break use <br> tag it is a self closing tag we donot need to close this tag manually. It is not a good practice to use <br> for line break.
        TO insert a Horizontal line use <hr> Horizontal Rule tag. it is also a self closing tag.

        How TO ADD TABLE <table> IN HTML
        wONDER WHAT DOES A TABLE CONSIST OF:
        1.Table Row         <tr>
            each table row can consist of a number of table datat<dt> or table header <th>
        2.Table Columns
        3.Data inside Row <td>

        Here are the tables tags presented in a table â€“ pun totally intended.

        Table Tag   	Meaning	         Location
        <thead> 	    Table Head  	Top of the table
        <tbody>	        Table Body  	Content of the table
        <tfoot>     	Table Foot	    Bottom of the table
        <colgroup>  	Column Group	Within the table
        <th>	        Table Header	Data cell for the table header

        Tables, borders, spacing are usually styled using

        What if in the same table an item takes more than one row or one column.
        For this <colspan> and <rowspan> comes to rescue when we have same item reflicing for more than one row or column.
        
        BLOCK-LEVEL and IN-LINE ELEMENTS.
        All the tags so far we have seen are block elements i.e., this elements begins and end with Carriage Returns.
        eg. <h1> tag occupy line above and below. each <p> set has implied space above and below it. Most of the
        HTML tag are block-level.

        While some tags are meant to be embedded inside block-level tags and don't interrupt the flow of the text. The anchor
        tag never stand on their own in HTML body.

        MAKING A LIST OF ANCHOR TAG / ABSOLUTE REFERENCE.

        Some nice programming books.
        * Html
        * Javascript
        * online programmings
        * html4

        WORKING WITH Absolute and Relative refrences
        ABSOLUTE REFERENCE: So far, we have seen only absolute reference absolute reference is complete web address which begins 
                            wiht http:// it is used to refer site somewhere else on internet.
        
        RELATIVE REFERENCE: This is used when the webpage you are building includes more than one page. we might choose to have
                            several pages and a link mechanism for moving among them.

        ------------------------------ADDING IMAGES , SOUNDS , VIDEO-----------------------------------
        
        Adding Images to your Pages
        EXTERNAL LINK <using p tag, a tag with href attribute>: tHE current page has a text with a link embedded on it. Here href points to an image 
        file, not an HTML page. We can point to any file  type. If the browser dosent know the file format. The user computer tries to open the file 
        using whatever program it normally uses to open.
            Drawback of external Link 1. They dont preview the image 2. They interupt the flow 3. The user must backup to return to main page.
        
        Adding the inline image to your page.
        Embedded Image <using img tag with src attribute>: The alternative to provider external link is to embed the image in the current page.
            ** If you use height and width attribute to change the image height the user still has to wait for the full image to be loaded.
                Though he will see a smaller version. So its not a best practice to use the height width attribute to change the img size.
                Makes sense, dont make user wait for things which he wont see. HaHaHa

        Images takes a lot of space and memory. So keep in mind.
        1. Make sure the images are worth displying.
        2. Use software to resize your image.
        3. Use a compressed format.

        You can use Irfan view  from www.irfanview.net to resize your image. Here are somemore

        * GimpShop.

        Working with AUDIO with <audio> tag
            The best way to be sure the sound plays is to supply two different formats. I've found that including both Ogg and MP3 formats ensure my audio will 
            play on all major browser.

            To add audio file to your page follow below steps.
            1.ADD THE AUDIO TAG TO YOUR PAGE: The <audio> tag indicates where and audio file will be placed. Where you place the tag in the code corresponds
                to where the CONTROL will appear.
            2.TURN ON CONTROLS:You can specify a control panel with the controls = "controls" attribute. if you dont include this directive then the audio
                will not be able to play the clip
            3.CREATE A <source> element or two: Inside the <audio> </audio> pair add one or more <source> elements. Each source element indicate a file
                you will link to.
            4.SET THE src ATTRIBUTE TO INDICATE THE FILE: THE src attribute of the source tag is used to indicate the file name of the audio file you
                wish to play.
            5.ADD ALTERNATE CODE FOR THE OLDER BROWSER: Any additional HTML code betweeen the audio tags will be interpreted only by browsers that do not 
                understand the audio tag.You can add an ordinary anchor to download the sound effect if you wish. this way older browser will also hear.
            
        Adding Video <video> to the HTML Page.
            The <video> tag is very similar to <audio> tag and it works in exactly the same way.

        Creating FORMS

        aLL THE form elements mus t be embed inside a <form></form> pair. The code for basicForm.html illustrates the simplest possible form.
        Forms can contain many components, but the most important are the input elements(text boxes ,buttons, drop-down lists and the like)

        A FIELDSET is a special element used to supply a visual grouping to a set of form elements.

        The Basic form has three elements:

        1. The <form> and </form> tags: these define the form as a part of the page. Dont Forget The NULL ACTION ATTRIBUTE ll discusll lateer about action
        2. The <fieldset> pair : This pair describes the included elements as a set of fields. this element is necessary , but it does
            give you some nice organization and lyout options later with we willuse CSS.
            Think fieldset as a blank canvas for adding visual design to your forms. 
        3. The <legend> tag : A part of the fieldset , this tag allows you to specify a legned for the entire fieldset. it is visible to the user
        4. The paragraphs: I somentime place each label and its correspoinding input element in a praragraph. This provides some nice formatting capabilites.
        5. The <label > tag: This tag allows you to specify a praticular chunk of text as lable. No formatting is done by default, but you can add later with CSS.
            The label has a optional for attribute that allow you to connect the lable with a specific input element.

        6. The <input> elements: The user types data into these elements.

        Making a Standard Text Field
        Name = Ram
        An input element has three common attribute type,id,value
        type: The type attribue indicates the type of input element this is . Our example sets type to text, creating a standard
                textbox. Other types would be passwords,hidden fields, check boxes and buttons.
        id: The id attribute create a identifier for the field. When we use a programming language to extract data from this element, use id to specify which field you're referring to.
        value: This attribute determines the default value of the text box.

        Other attribue of textbox are:
        size: This attribute determines the number of characters that are displayed.
        maxlength: Use this attribue to set the largest number o characters that are allowed.

        *** There is no </input> tag. Input tags are a leftover from the days when many tags did not have ending tags. You just end the original tag with a slash character.

        Building a password field

        MAKING MULTI-LINE TEXT INPUT <textarea>
            The single line text field is a powerful feature, but sometimes , you want something with a bit more space.
        Few things to keep in mind when using the <textarea> tag:
            * It needs and id attribute, just like an input element.
            * You can specify the size with rows and cols attributes.
            * The content goes between the tags.

        CREATING MULTIPLE SELECTION ELEMENTS 
        Sometimes we want to present the user with a list of choices and then have them pick one of these elements.
        HTML have a number of ways to do this.

        MAKING SELECTIONS.
        The DROP DOWN LIST IS A FAVORITE SELECTION TOOOL OF THE WEB DEVELOPERS.
        1. It saves screen space: Only current selection is shown.
        2. It limits Input.
        2. The value can be different than what the user sees: This seems odd advantage , but it tends to be very useful sometimes.
            eg What is your favorite color Red,Green,Blue etc goes to drpdwn
        The select object is a bit different from some of the other input elements youre used to such as.
        * It's Surrounded by a <select> pair .These tags indicate the entire list.
        * The select object has an id attribute: Although the select object has may other tags inside, typiclly only the select object itselh has and id attribute.
        * it Contains a sereis of <option> pairs: Each individual selection is housed in an <option></option> set
        * The content between the <option></option> is visible to user not the value

        ** #ff0000 : These are hex codes and its a good way to describe color.

        BUILDING CHECK BOXES
        Check boxes are used when you want the user to turn a particual choice on or off.
            eg.--
        We use the same attributes of the <input> tage i.e type , buth they worka bit differently the way thet do in a pain old txtBox.

        * The type is checkbox: thats how the browser knows to make a checkbox rether than a field.
        * The checkbox still requires an ID: If you ll be writing programming code to work with this thing you ll need an ID for ref.
        * The value is hidden from the user: The user dosent see the actual value. Thats for the programmer.

        CREATING RADIO BUTTONS
        Radio Buttons are used when you want to let the user pick only one option from a group.
        * Only one can be checked at a time.
        * They have to be in group.
        * They all have the same name! Each radio button has its own id(like other input elements), but they have a name attribute.
            The name attribute indicates the group a radio button is in.
        * You can have more than one group in a page: Just us a different name attribute for each group.
        * One of them has to be selected.
        eg.

        Pressing the BUTTONS

        HTML5 also comes with several types of buttons. We use these guys to make something actually happen. When user clicks
