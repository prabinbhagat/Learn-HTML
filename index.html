<!--Brief summary
HTML IS the languae in which most websites are written.
HTML is used to create webpages and make then functional.
The code used to make then visually appealing is known as CSS.

HTML was created by Sir Tim Bernes Lee in the year 1989.
HT-HyperText-Meaning it contains links to other places in the document or to a new document altogether.
ML-MarkupLanguage is the language computer used to communicate and process and present text. Now to do this it uses

Tags & Attributes they are the basis of HTML they work together but perform different functions.

TAGS are used to markup the start of the HTML element and they are usually enclosed in the angel brackets. eg  <h1>
Most tags must be opened <h1> and closed </h1> to make them functional.

ATTRIBUTES contains additional pieces of information. It takes the form of opening tag and additional information is placed inside
eg. <img src = "ram.jpg" alt = "This is a picture of ram"> 
in the above case image source (src) and alternate text (alt) are attribute of img tag.

Now lets see the basic construction of a HTML page
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>     <!--This tag specifies the language we will write in the page in our case it is HTML5-->>
<html lang="en">    <!--This tag signals from here we will write HTML code-->
<head>              <!--This tag contains all the METADATA FOR THE PAGE stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer program-->
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>              <!--This body tag is where all the DCONTENT OF THE PAGES goes-->
    
</body>
</html>

<!-------------------So as shown above all the average HTML page is structured visually-------------------->

<!--Lets See some more Tags-
    Inside the <head> tag there is one tag which is always included which is <title> tag
        <title> this is where we will inculde the page name that is displayed on top of browser or tab </title>
        <meta> this is where all the information about the document is stored: like character encoding,name(page content),description

        Basic <head> section
        <head>
            <title> my first webpage </title>
            <meta charset = "utf-8">
            <meta name = "description" content = "this field include description about your page. it is usually two sentence lomg.">
            <meta name = "author Prabiin"  content = "Conor Sheilaji">
        </head>
        
    Next tag is <body> tag
        The HTML <body> is where we add all the content which is designed to view by human eyes.
        this includes text,images,tables, forms and everyting ele that we see on the internet each day.

        In HTML headings are written in following elements
        <h1>
            <h2>
                <h3>
                    <h4>
                        <h5>
                            <h6>
        
        <h1> and <h2> should be used for most important titles , while the remainings tags should be used for sub headings
        
        search engine bots uses this order for deciphering which infromation is most important on a page.

        In HTML text can be added using <p> paragraph tags
        <p> tag creates a NEW PARAGRAPH we place all of our regular text inside the element</p>

        For writng Text in HTML, we also have a number of other elements we can use to CONTROL THE TEXT OR MAKE IT APPEAR IN A CERTAIN WAY
        
        OTHER KEY ELEMENTS ARE

        Element	    Meaning	             Purpose
        <b>	        Bold	             Highlight important information
        <strong>	Strong	             Similarly to bold, to highlight key text
        <i>	        Italic	             To denote text
        <em>    	Emphasised Text      Usually used as image captions
        <mark>  	Marked Text	         Highlight the background of the text
        <small> 	Small Text	         To shrink the text
        <strike>	Striked Out Text     To place a horizontal line across the text
        <u>	        Underlined Text	     Used for links or text highlights
        <ins>	    Inserted Text	     Displayed with an underline to show an inserted text
        <sub>   	Subscript Text  	 Typographical stylistic choice
        <sup>   	Superscript Text	 Another typographical presentation style

        These tags must be opened and closed around the text in question.

        HOW TO ADD LINK IN MY HTML--<a> tag to rescue
        Links are included in an attribute opened by <a> tag.

            The ANCHOR Tag <a> is writtet in the format
            <a href = "www.google.com">Google Website</a>
            here the first part is the link that gets open when user clicks and the second part is the text that will get displayed.

            If you are building a website of you own then the internal links on your website will be :
            <a href = "mylinkedpage.html">linktitle</a>

        The IMAGE <img> tag has everthing to display images on a website.   
        Like anchor tag image tag also has attribute .
        The ATTRIBUTE FEATURES information for your computer regarding the SOURCE,HEIGHT,WIDTH and ALT TEXT of the image.

        We can also define the borders and other styles around image using the CLASS attribute.
        The file types generally used for image files online are: .jpg, .png, and (less and less) .gif.
